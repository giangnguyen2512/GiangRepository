    <b> <h2 style="text-decoration:underline">House music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, and Newark â€“ all of which developed their own regional scenes.Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines,off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic,and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself.</h2> </b>
